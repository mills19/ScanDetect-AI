Summary:
This model that I've build is basically a simple model which classifies whether a patient's brain is tumorous or not by just processing MRI scan of the patient's brain. It detects tumor in a patient's brain if there exists one.


Abstract:
This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the automated detection of brain tumors from MRI scan images. The project workflow includes comprehensive data collection, preprocessing to enhance image quality, and augmentation to increase dataset diversity. The model architecture is meticulously designed, incorporating convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.  Future work will focus on integrating more diverse datasets and exploring advanced techniques to further enhance model performance and reliability.
